<h1> Ybyr&aacute; - SVG Hyperbolic Tree JavaScript Library</h1>

<p>By Sidney Leal (sidney@manish.com.br)</p>

<p>Ybyr&aacute; is a javascript library to create hyperbolic trees with SVG. Yes, it's beta and need a lot of improvements (any help will be appreciated), but it's usable. </p>

<p>The hypertree calculations came from Cristophe Bouthier and his java hypertree lib: <a href="http://hypertree.sourceforge.net">hypertree.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>The animations and SVG manipulation is done with Raphael: <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">raphaeljs.com</a>.</p>
